# GPipe 2+

While the `geometry-shader` branch introduces an experimental support for geometry shaders in the GPipe 2 library,
this branch goes further by adding transform feedback and refactoring code more liberally.
I'm actually entertaining the idea of rewriting GPipe 2 in [a literal way](https://wiki.haskell.org/Literate_programming),
remembering how hard it was for me to make sense of the original code base.
